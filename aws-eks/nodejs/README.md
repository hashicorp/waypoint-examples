Requirements:

- You must create an ECR registry named `waypoint-example` (or choose your own name and edit `waypoint.hcl`).
- Create an EKS cluster as shown at [HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/eks?in=terraform/kubernetes).
- Configure `kubectl` to communicate to the Kubernetes cluster (also covered in the tutorial above).
