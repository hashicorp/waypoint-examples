# waypoint-examples

These are example applications for use with [Waypoint](https://waypointproject.io/).

## Getting Started

If you're new to Waypoint, following the [Getting Started](https://waypointproject.io/docs/getting-started) tutorial. That tutorial utilizes applications in this repository. Most of the example applications only require that you have Docker and Waypoint installed. 

Several of the examples show how to use Waypoint with [Kubernetes](https://waypointproject.io/docs/getting-started/k8s-example-app) or [Nomad](https://waypointproject.io/docs/getting-started/nomad-example-app).

## Deploying Examples

Prerequisite: Verify that the waypoint CLI is able to reach the Waypoint server with `waypoint context verify`.

You can experiment with the different examples by entering
each directory and running `waypoint init` followed by `waypoint up`.
